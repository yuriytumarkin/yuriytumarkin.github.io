Currently I am interested in two extensions of the classical theory of translation surfaces and interval exchange transformations. Firstly, I'm 
studying the ergodic properties of the straight-line flow on infinite covers of translation surfaces, and correspondingly skew-products over IETs.

Secondly, I'm interested in IETs with flips and the analogue of a translation structure defined on non-orientable surfaces.

	While it has been known since the work of Frączek and Ulcigrai (2014) that generically the wind-tree model is not ergodic and 
	even non-transitive, little is known about what the trajectories look like. We construct explicit invariant sets for the flow. 
	Using this and a symbolic coding we show that when the underlying compact translation surface is periodic for the Teichmüller flow, 
	and the cover is given by an unstable homology class, the Hausdorff dimension of every orbit closure of the billiard flow is 
	non-maximal.

	It turns out that even if starting with a uniquely ergodic IET, its skew-products can have many invariant measures. A particularly nice
	family of invariant measures for infinite skew-products are the *Maharam measures*, which scale under the Deck group action. Here we show that 
	for the special case of skew-products which are periodic under an extension of Rauzy-Veech induction, the ergodic invariant measures are 
	precisely these Maharam measures. For the proof we use symbolic coding and apply a symbolic result of Aaronson, Nakada, Sarig and Solomyak. <br>
	
	In addition, using an extension of the Rauzy-Veech cocycle adapted to infinite skew-products, 
	we show that the Maharam measure depends continuously on the scaling parameter.

This is the outcome of a summer research project done in 2020, supervised by Yuri B. Suris (TU Berlin), together with Misha Schmalian. <br>

We studied the geometry of discrete integrable systems generated by birational maps preserving elliptic curves, and constructed a new one-parameter family of such maps with degree 6 integrals.
This family is an example of an integrable discretisation of a continuous integrable system, discretised via Kahan's method with some higher order term modifications.
