Currently I am studying infinite translation surfaces, in particular I am interested in the ergodic properties of the linear flow on periodic 
surfaces.

	It turns out that even if starting with a uniquely ergodic IET, its skew-products can have many invariant measures. A particularly nice
	family of invariant measures for infinite skew-products are the *Maharam measures*, which scale under the Deck group action. Here we show that 
	for the special case of skew-products which are periodic under an extension of Rauzy-Veech induction, the ergodic invariant measures are 
	precisely these Maharam measures. For the proof we use symbolic coding and apply a symbolic result of Aaronson, Nakada, Sarig and Solomyak.

This is the outcome of a summer research project done in 2020, supervised by Yuri B. Suris (TU Berlin), together with Misha Schmalian. <br>

We studied the geometry of discrete integrable systems generated by birational maps preserving elliptic curves, and constructed a new one-parameter family of such maps with degree 6 integrals.
This family is an example of an integrable discretisation of a continuous integrable system, discretised via Kahan's method with some higher order term modifications.
