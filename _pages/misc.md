### QGIS
I did a small project using QGIS and Python to map average house prices by postcode for various cities in the UK. I used data from HM Land Registry and the Ordnance Survey.

I heard about the East End vs West End divide and the theory that house prices are in general lower in eastern parts of cities due to the prevailing westerly winds that used to blow smoke from factories towrads the east.
However when I made the maps I did not see any very clear trend in most cities, with the exception of Sheffield, where this divide is indeed immediately obvious.

Here are a few of the maps (the colours show the average house prices relative to all the postcodes in the city, yellow are the most expensive and purple the cheapest):
