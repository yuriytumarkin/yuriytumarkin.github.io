Here are some Geogebra programs that I made for [Science Lab UZH Slow Chaos workshops](https://www.sciencelab.uzh.ch/de/fuer-schulen/workshops/slowchaos.html) 
for school students.

* [Billiards in an ellipse](/files/slowchaos/ellipse4.ggb) (as a first step in Penrose's solution to the illumination problem)


* [Cutting sequences for the straight line flow on a torus](/files/slowchaos/cuttingseq.ggb) The goal here is to find patterns in cutting sequences and hence to characterise the 
possible cutting sequences using the idea of derivation (see Caroline Series, [*"The Geometry of Markoff Numbers"*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03025802))
