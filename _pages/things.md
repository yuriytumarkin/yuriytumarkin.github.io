## Part III Essay: Displaceability of Lagrangian Toric Fibres
Supervised by Jack Smith (DPMMS, Cambridge). Exposition of main results of two papers by Dusa McDuff and Miguel Abreu & Leonardo Macarini showing methods to show respectively the displaceability or non-displaceability
of the fibres. I found some new examples of applications of the method of Abreu and Macarini, showing that the phenomena they observed in two dimensions also take place in three dimensions. <br>

## Essay: Groups Acting on Trees

Set by Henry Wilton (DPMMS, Cambridge). An exposition of Bass-Serre theory, mostly following Serre's "Trees".<br>

## The Archimedeans (Cambridge University Mathematics Society)

Between April 2020 and March 2021 I was the External Secretary of the society, responsible for inviting speakers for weekly talks and organising these talks. I also organised a series of student talks.

Most of the talks were recorded and the recordings are available on the [society Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdswONpWjfKTbpkBUP4fOyA/videos).


## Talk: Beatty's Theorem via Cutting Sequences

This talk is about cutting sequences, presenting a geometrical proof of Beatty's Theorem, and also discussing the Fibonacci word and Wythoff's game. It's based on
chapter 2 of S. Tabachnikov's *Geometry and Billiards*. <br>
I've presented it twice: once at my school, and once as an online talk at the Archimedeans.

[Here](../files/cutting_sequences.pdf) are the slides from the online talk.

## STIMULUS

In autumn 2019 I volunteered at a primary school, teaching extension maths lessons for a group of six 10 year olds, for an hour once a week. We covered some introductory combinatorics, played around with loci
(which we made physically using string and blu-tac!) and cut some MÃ¶bius bands.

[Here](stimulus/) are the handouts I made for them.


## Durham Johnston School Maths Society

I organised the school maths society in my last two years of school (2016-2018). This involved making problem sheets for the weekly sessions and discussing the problems with the other students.

The goal was two-fold: firstly to introduce the other students to the (mostly absent from the school curriculum) concept of mathematical proof, and secondly to show some fun areas of maths they might not have seen otherwise.

[Here](mathsoc/) are the problem sheets I made.
