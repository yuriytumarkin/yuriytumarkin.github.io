### What is a ... translation surface? Zurich Graduate Colloquium talk
[Slides](../files/slides/translationsurface.pdf)

[Geogebra simulation of the Teichm√ºller geodesic flow on the moduli space of tori](https://www.geogebra.org/m/e3br6gws)

### Three minute presentation for the School on Flat Surfaces and Interactions, Le Teich, March 2024

### Part III Essay: Displaceability of Lagrangian Toric Fibres
Supervised by Jack Smith (DPMMS, Cambridge). Exposition of main results of two papers by Dusa McDuff and Miguel Abreu & Leonardo Macarini showing methods to show respectively the displaceability or non-displaceability
of the fibres. I found some new examples of applications of the method of Abreu and Macarini, showing that the phenomena they observed in two dimensions also take place in three dimensions. <br>

### Essay: Groups Acting on Trees

Set by Henry Wilton (DPMMS, Cambridge). An exposition of Bass-Serre theory, mostly following Serre's "Trees".<br>

### Talk: Beatty's Theorem via Cutting Sequences

This talk is about cutting sequences, presenting a geometrical proof of Beatty's Theorem, and also discussing the Fibonacci word and Wythoff's game. It's based on
chapter 2 of S. Tabachnikov's *Geometry and Billiards*. <br>
I've presented it twice: once at my school, and once as an online talk at the Archimedeans (the Cambridge student maths society).
