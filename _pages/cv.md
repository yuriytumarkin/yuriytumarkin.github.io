**Summer Research Project** - Summer 2020, supervised by Yuri B. Suris (TU Berlin), together with Misha Schmalian. <br>

We studied the geometry of discrete integrable systems generated by birational maps preserving elliptic curves, and constructed a new one-parameter family of such maps with degree 6 integrals.
This family is an example of an integrable discretisation of a continuous integrable system, discretised via Kahan's method with some higher order term modifications.
