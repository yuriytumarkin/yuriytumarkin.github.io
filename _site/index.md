I'm currently a third-year PhD student at the University of Zurich. My supervisor is [Corinna Ulcigrai](https://user.math.uzh.ch/ulcigrai/).

Broadly speaking my mathematical interests lie in the intersection of dynamics and geometry. Right now I'm mostly thinking about infinite translation surfaces.

My CV is available here: [CV](/files/cv2024.pdf)
